I'm a hard working and ambitious student and life long learner specializing in embedded systems, electronics hardware design, and power control systems. I love creating real-world solutions by blending programming, circuitry, and problem solving. I hope to use this profile to document all of my projects and hopefully acheive my goal of becoming an engineer related to embedded systems deveopment.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a number of school projects, power system schematic projects, and a electronic device to be used in industry.
-  ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning designing PCBs, FPGA's, Real-Time Operating Systems and IoT, and more.
